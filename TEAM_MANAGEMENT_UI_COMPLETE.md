## 🔧 Constants & Types Enhanced

### Added to `src/lib/constants/index.ts`:

```typescript
export interface ModuleInfo {
  name: PermissionModule;
  displayName: string;
  description?: string;
  category: 'workflow' | 'services' | 'operations' | 'admin';
}

export const MODULE_INFO: Record<PermissionModule, ModuleInfo> = {
  // Contains all 21 modules with metadata
  [PERMISSION_MODULES.TASKS]: {
    name: 'tasks',
    displayName: 'Tasks',
    description: 'Create and manage tasks',
    category: 'workflow',
  },
  // ... (20 more modules)
};
```

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Hooks Used
- `useTeams` - All team CRUD operations
- `useEmployees` - Employee list and search
- `useFormState` - Form validation and state
- Supabase client - Direct permission queries

### Data Flow
1. **TeamManagement** fetches all teams → displays grid
2. **Click "New Team"** → opens TeamForm → creates team → refetches
3. **Click "Members"** → opens TeamMembersModal → fetches employees → add/remove → refetches team
4. **Click "Permissions"** → opens TeamPermissionsModal → fetches permissions → configure → saves → refetches team

## 🧪 Next Steps

### Immediate Testing Needed
1. ✅ Create a new team
2. ✅ Add members to team
3. ✅ Configure permissions
4. ✅ Verify permissions in database
5. ✅ Test permission checks in app
6. ✅ Edit team details
7. ✅ Remove team members
8. ✅ Delete team

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Team member roles within team (lead, member, etc.)
- [ ] Permission templates for quick setup
- [ ] Bulk member import (CSV upload)
- [ ] Team activity logs
- [ ] Permission inheritance from parent teams
- [ ] Team-based notifications
- [ ] Permission analytics dashboard

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Dependencies
- Requires `teams`, `team_members`, `permissions`, `team_permissions` tables
- Migration script must be run first: `sql/teams_permissions_system.sql`
- Default teams created via: `sql/migrate_roles_to_teams.sql`

### Permission System
- Permissions are company-scoped (RLS policies enforce isolation)
- User can be in multiple teams (permissions aggregate with OR logic)
- Permission checks happen at:
  1. Middleware (route protection)
  2. AuthContext (navigation filtering)
  3. Component level (UI conditional rendering)

### Type Safety
- All components use TypeScript with strict mode
- Type definitions in `src/lib/types/schemas.ts`
- No runtime validation (pure TypeScript interfaces)
